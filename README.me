# FrankenPHP WebSocket Extension

This project demonstrates how to use the **Go extension** in **FrankenPHP** to implement a **native WebSocket server** directly integrated into FrankenPHP — without relying on an external proxy or process.

## 🧩 Overview

This extension extends FrankenPHP with native WebSocket capabilities written in **Go**, seamlessly bridging PHP and Go through the FrankenPHP runtime.

It allows PHP developers to manage WebSocket connections **directly from PHP code**, while leveraging the high-performance concurrency model of Go.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Native WebSocket server embedded within FrankenPHP  
- Fully event-driven and lightweight  
- Direct PHP functions to interact with connected clients  
- No external dependencies or additional WebSocket daemons required  

---

## 🧠 Available PHP Functions

Two PHP functions are exposed by the extension:

### `frankenphp_ws_getClients()`
Returns the list of currently connected WebSocket clients.  
You can use this to iterate through clients and broadcast messages.

### `frankenphp_ws_send($clientId, $message)`
Sends a message to a specific connected client.  
Ideal for targeted communication or server push scenarios.

---

## 🚀 Example Usage (PHP)

```php
<?php

$clients = frankenphp_ws_getClients();

foreach ($clients as $client) {
    frankenphp_ws_send($client, json_encode(['event' => 'ping', 'time' => time()]));
}
